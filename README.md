# Email Spam Classification

## Overview

This is a project that I have decided to take on during the holidays. This project involves developing a machine learning(ML) model to help classify emails as spam or not spam. The dataset I have used for training this model is sourced from kaggle.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is available at [Kaggle - Spam Email Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashfakyeafi/spam-email-classification). It contains a collection of emails labeled as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam), which is used to train and test the classification model.

## Model Performance

The model developed in this project achieves an average accuracy of 98%. This high level of accuracy indicates strong performance in distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails.

## Requirements

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Usage

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-spam-classification.git
   ```
2. Install Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```
